<a href="/space/index.html">Space shooter v1</a> - z to shoot, arrows to move. followed the <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial">Space shooter tutorial</a> from Unity. Thanks folks for the clear introduction!

<a href="/millikan1/index.html">Millikan's oil droplet v1</a> - very basic, just a model of a droplet, and it is slowly rising. bug: top plate rises too... needed to turn off rigidbody for top plate.
<br />
<br />
<a href="/millikan2/index.html">Millikan's oil droplet v2</a> - updated, a little nicer. fixed bug. changed camera angle. 
<br />
<br />
<a href="/millikan3/index.html">Millikan's oil droplet v3</a> - z makes charge more +, x makes more -. color coding in text and droplet shading. droplet texture now weird and doesn't change like expected.
<br />
<br />
<a href="/millikan5/index.html">Millikan's oil droplet v5</a> - z makes charge more +, x makes more -. r resets. color coding in text only. cannot figure out how to change color for webGL.
